  <h2>Pollution is when harmful things like trash, chemicals, or smoke get into our air, water, and soil.
     This can make it hard for plants, animals, and even people to live and grow. For example, dirty air can make it hard for us to breathe,
     and polluted water can make fish and other animals sick. By keeping our environment clean, we help all living things stay healthy and happy!</h2>
